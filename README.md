Hello Fellow Earthlings!

Travis here, I am new to the coding realm! I am learning through the full stack course on FreeCodeCamp. I drink way too much coffee, I have a Siberian Husky named Sasha, I enjoy going to the beach and all things wilderness. You can follow my journey and connect with me on Twtter! Give me a follow @ Travis_Codes! 

Goodbye for now! 
Travis
